# Youkassa Payment Integration Setup

## Overview

The VPN bot now supports both cryptocurrency payments (via CryptoBot) and card payments (via Youkassa) in Russian rubles.

## Features

- **Dual Payment Options**: Users can choose between crypto (USDT) and card (RUB) payments
- **Real-time Payment Processing**: Automatic payment verification and subscription activation

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Youkassa Configuration
YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id_here
YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The Youkassa SDK is already included in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files

- `payment_utils.py` - Payment processing functions
- `main.py` - Bot conversation handlers
- `config.py` - Configuration and pricing

### New Functions

- `get_yookassa_payment_details()` - Creates Youkassa payment
- `verify_yookassa_payment()` - Verifies payment status
- `get_yookassa_payment_status()` - Gets payment status

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback for payment failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing

### Test Mode

For testing, you can use Youkassa's test environment:

1. Use test credentials from Youkassa dashboard
2. Test payments will not charge real money
3. All payment flows work identically to production

### Test Script

Run the test script to verify integration:

```bash
python test_yookassa.py
```

## Security Considerations

- All payment data is processed securely through Youkassa
- No sensitive payment information is stored locally
- Payment verification happens server-side
- HTTPS encryption for all API communications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Youkassa is not configured. Please set YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID and YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY in your environment variables."**

   - Add the required environment variables to your `.env` file:
     ```bash
     YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id_here
     YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
     ```
   - Make sure both variables are set and not empty
   - Restart the bot after adding the credentials

2. **"account_id and secret_key are required"**

   - This error occurs when Youkassa credentials are missing or invalid
   - Double-check your Shop ID and Secret Key from the Youkassa dashboard
   - Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the values

3. **"Оплата картой временно недоступна"**

   - This is a user-friendly message shown when Youkassa is not configured
   - Users will be prompted to use crypto payment instead
   - Configure Youkassa credentials to enable card payments

4. **Payment verification fails**

   - Check Youkassa dashboard for payment status
   - Verify webhook configuration (if using)

5. **Import errors**
   - Ensure `yookassa` package is installed: `pip install yookassa`
   - Check Python environment and dependencies

### Logs

Check logs for detailed error information:

```bash
tail -f bot.log
```
