# Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem

The bot was failing to start on Render with this error:

```
Bot runtime error: Updater.start_polling() got an unexpected keyword argument 'read_timeout'
```

## Root Cause

I had added unsupported parameters to the `start_polling()` method that aren't available in the version of python-telegram-bot being used on Render.

## Solution

Removed the unsupported parameters from `start_polling()`:

### Before (Broken)

```python
await application.updater.start_polling(
    drop_pending_updates=True,
    allowed_updates=Update.ALL_TYPES,
    read_timeout=30,        # ❌ Not supported
    write_timeout=30,       # ❌ Not supported
    connect_timeout=30,     # ❌ Not supported
    pool_timeout=30         # ❌ Not supported
)
```

### After (Fixed)

```python
await application.updater.start_polling(
    drop_pending_updates=True,
    allowed_updates=Update.ALL_TYPES
)
```

## Additional Fixes

### 1. Environment Variables

Fixed the `.env` file format for Youkassa credentials:

**Before (Broken):**

```bash
YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID = "1123620"
YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY = "test__7PlwuTB2srpohWVltpGdtQYqsVM3oUi-7aKqEC2vTY"
```

**After (Fixed):**

```bash
YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID=1123620
YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY=test__7PlwuTB2srpohWVltpGdtQYqsVM3oUi-7aKqEC2vTY
```

### 2. Simplified Error Handling

Removed complex retry logic that could cause issues and simplified the main loop.

## Status: ✅ Fixed

The bot should now deploy successfully on Render and Youkassa payments should work correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy** your bot on Render
2. **Test the Youkassa payment flow** by running `/subscribe` and choosing the card payment option
3. **Monitor logs** to ensure everything is working correctly

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Check that the bot starts without errors
2. Test the Youkassa payment flow
3. Verify that both crypto and card payments are available
