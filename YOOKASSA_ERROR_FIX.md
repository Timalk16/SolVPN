# Youkassa Error Fix Summary

## Problem

The bot was throwing this error when users tried to use card payments:

```
Error creating Youkassa payment: account_id and secret_key are required
```

## Root Cause

The Youkassa SDK was being initialized at module import time, but the credentials weren't properly configured or validated.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Configuration Validation

- Added `YOOKASSA_CONFIGURED` flag to track if credentials are properly set
- Added proper error handling during configuration initialization
- Added validation for both `YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID` and `YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY`

### 2. Updated Payment Functions

- All Youkassa functions now check `YOOKASSA_CONFIGURED` before proceeding
- Clear error messages when credentials are missing
- Graceful fallback behavior

### 3. Improved User Experience

- When Youkassa is not configured, users see a friendly message:

  ```
